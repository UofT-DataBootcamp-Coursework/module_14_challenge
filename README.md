## Analysis

### Bike-sharing program in Des Moines: a smart, eco-friendly, and profitable solution

**What is the population of Des Moines?** 

Total population of Des Moines, Iowa (as at July 2019) is 214,237. Of this, roughly 51% identify as female and 49% as male. About 64% of the population are between the ages of 18 to 65, 25% are under 18, and 12% are above 65.

**How does its population compare to the population of New York City?**

New York City overall has a substantially larger population (8,336,817), however the gender and age proportions are quite similar.

**Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?**

All things considered, the population of Des Moines is similar in composition to the population of New York City, therefore we assume a similar trend with the overall user base of Citi Bike users. Des Moines would not need to have nearly as many bikes for rent as New York City offers, so as long as the majority of costs associated with operating a bike-rental program are variable, a scaled down version would be appropriate and should not reduce the overall profit margin potential.

**Amount of trails/parks to explore**

Des Moines has over 800 miles of trails to explore, something of interest for both local residents as well as visitors to the city. A potential partnership with the local parks and recreation department could provide an opportunity to not just penetrate the urban area, but to have the bike-rental program offered in all the city-run green spaces as well.

**Tourism related**

Des Moines is the largest city in Iowa, and is becoming and up-and-coming tourist location. With over 150,000 tourists descending into Des Moines every year to just attend the annual state fair, coupled with a booming tourism industry within the heart of the city, there are plenty of excuses to jump on a rental bike and explore the various offerings of the city.

**Temperature comparison**

As biking is heavily reliant on warmer temperatures, when comparing New York City to Des Moines, New York City is slighly warmer on average on a month-to-month basis, however during peak summer months, both cities experience fairly warm/hot average temperatures, ideal for any cyclist.
